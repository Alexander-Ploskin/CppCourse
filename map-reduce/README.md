# Map-Reduce Tool
This is a [Map-Reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) tool implemented in C++ using OpenMP, which provides a simple method of parallelizing operations on data. It consists of two functions, *map* and *reduce*, which can be used to apply a function to each element in an input vector (map), and then reduce the mapped results into a single output value (reduce).
